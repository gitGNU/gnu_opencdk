Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.7 (unreleased)
------------------------------------------------


Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.6 (2007-11-15)
------------------------------------------------

* Slightly adjust the stream code.
  The check for fflush is obmitted because the return
  value might be undefined. This fixes a problem reported
  from the NetBSD team.
  
* Don't use __inline__ in src/cipher.c (breaks on Sun CC).

* Tiny documentation fixes for gtk-doc.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.5 (2007-10-27)
------------------------------------------------

* Cleanups for the key export and import functionality.

* Clarified the semantic of cdk_pk_check_sigs.

* Now the by usage keydb function correctly finds the
  self signature.
  

Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.4 (2007-06-12)
------------------------------------------------

* Make sure the test suite uses non-guessable file names
  for temporary files.

* Fix a problem in the file handling code.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.3 (2007-06-06)
------------------------------------------------

* Remove unused references in the opencdk config script.
  This fixes an error because a variable were not referenced.

Interface changes relative to 0.6.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cdk_dek_get_cipher		   NEW
cdk_dek_get_mdc_flag		   NEW


Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.2 (2007-05-25)
------------------------------------------------

* Fix versioning script of the library.

* Bug fixes for the remaining memory leaks.

* Better way to handle gcrypt initialization.

Interface changes relative to 0.6.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cdk_lit_format_t		   NEW

functions:
cdk_pk_to_fingerprint		   NEW


Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.1 (2007-05-12)
------------------------------------------------

* The opencdk.def file is included in the distribution archive,
  fixes build failures on mingw32.

* Some bug fixes for the mingw32 build in combination with WINE.

* Now the decryption code uses the name in the literal packet
  for the output file whenever this is possible.

* Take care of absolute file names in literal packets.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.0 (2007-05-01)
------------------------------------------------

* Dropped all internal random, cipher, digest libs and only use gcrypt 
  for such tasks. The library should only provide functions dedicated
  to parsing and packet creation for the protocol.

* Adjust code for the new Libgcrypt interface.
  Now Libgcrypt >1.2.2 is required to build the code.

* This new version introduces an API change and thus incompatibilities 
  to prior versions.

* Lots of cleanups all over the place. This also includes simplification 
  for various code parts.

* Better support for larger files.

* Map the libgcrypt error directly and remove the
  invalid CDK_Gcry_Error type.

* Add more regression tests for the various code parts.

* We do not support ElGamal signatures any longer.

* Merged patches from the other opencdk branch which is
  currently used by GnuTLS.

* Provide user callback for the stream. As a sample
  implementation, socket callbacks are implemented
  and use in cdk_stream_sockopen().
  
* Drop most of the rfc1991 legacy format. This means
  we do not generate any rfc1991 data, but we still
  understand it. An exception is the packet header output.

* Removed gnulib interface for now because the lib
  is currently not in use.

* Interfaces changes relative to 0.5.x
